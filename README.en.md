# VelaShell

> A modern, cross-platform SSH terminal client built for sysadmins and developers.

[简体中文](README.md) · **English**

VelaShell is a desktop terminal application built with .NET 11 and Avalonia, running on Windows, Linux and macOS. It ships its own VT terminal engine, SSH/SFTP/FTP connectivity, local shell tabs, jump hosts (ProxyJump) and network proxies (HTTP / SOCKS5 / follow-system), two-step authentication with host fingerprint verification, port-forwarding tunnels, grouped session management, the in-house VelaDock split/dock workspace, remote resource monitoring and traceroute, a command palette and a twelve-page settings centre; it can also be launched externally by bastion hosts and SSO portals using Xshell's calling convention. On top of that sits a **dual-mode plugin system** (in-process / isolated process) and a first-party **AI assistant plugin**. Everything is persisted, encrypted, into an embedded SonnetDB database. The goal is a **keyboard-first, information-dense, snappy** experience for heavy remote work.

## 🪶 About the name

**Pronunciation**: `/ˈveɪlə ʃɛl/` — say it as **"VAY-la shell"**, stress on the first syllable.

**Meaning**: **Vela** + **Shell**.

- **Vela** — Latin for "sails". Vela is a southern constellation which, together with Carina (the keel) and Puppis (the stern), was split out of Argo Navis — the ship Jason and the Argonauts sailed in search of the Golden Fleece. It carries the sense of **setting sail for distant shores**.
- **Shell** — the command-line shell, and the heart of this app: a terminal attached to a remote host.

Together, VelaShell means **"a terminal as your sail, riding the signal winds to remote hosts"**. The icon distills that idea: a dark `>_` prompt on a teal gradient rounded square.

## ✨ Features

### Terminal and connectivity

- **In-house VT terminal engine**  
  A full DEC ANSI / VT / Xterm state machine: 256 colours, true colour, DEC line-drawing glyphs, primary/alternate screens, scroll regions, application cursor keys, mouse protocols, CJK double-width characters and on-the-fly encoding switching. Ten terminal profiles are built in (vt52/100/102/220/320/340/420/520/xterm/xterm-256color), defaulting to xterm-256color. The terminal is a custom-drawn Avalonia control — glyphs, selection and scrolling are all rendered by us. Selection supports linear and block modes, `Shift+click` to extend, and **disjoint multi-span selection** via `Ctrl+Shift+drag` (copy line 1 and line 3 in one go). **OSC 8 hyperlinks** emitted by modern CLIs (`ls --hyperlink`, `gh`, `delta`, cargo/gcc diagnostics) are underlined and open on `Ctrl+click`, even when the anchor text looks nothing like a URL; schemes are allow-listed because terminal output is untrusted input.

- **SSH, SFTP and local shells**  
  Shell sessions, SFTP transfers and port forwarding are powered by [Tmds.Ssh](https://github.com/tmds/Tmds.Ssh) (a fully managed, async-first .NET SSH library). Password and private-key auth are supported; when credentials are missing the app walks a two-step authentication flow (username → auth method) and lets you retry in place after a failure. **Local terminal tabs** auto-detect pwsh / PowerShell / CMD / WSL / Git Bash — implemented on ConPTY, so they are **Windows-only for now**.

- **Jump hosts (ProxyJump)**  
  A session can reference another saved profile as its jump host, chained up to 5 hops with cycle detection. Chains are built hop by hop through Tmds.Ssh's native `SshProxy`, and fingerprints are verified per logical host at every hop.

- **Network proxy**  
  A global proxy setting (Settings → Proxy): direct / follow system / HTTP CONNECT / SOCKS5, with proxy authentication and an option to let SOCKS5 resolve DNS proxy-side (so target hostnames never leak). It applies to **all outbound traffic** — SSH, FTP, and HTTP requests such as cloud sync and update checks.

- **Xshell-compatible launch (external invocation)**  
  VelaShell can be launched by third-party security clients using Xshell's (and SecureCRT's / PuTTY's) calling convention: the user clicks "open in terminal" on a bastion host or SSO portal, and the one-time credential is handed straight to VelaShell — the user never sees the password. Includes URL protocol registration and single-instance forwarding; threat model and credential handling in [`velashell-docs en/host/xshell-compatible-login.md`](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/host/xshell-compatible-login.md).

- **ZMODEM (rz / sz), XMODEM (rx / sx), YMODEM (rb / sb)**  
  Transfer files straight from the terminal. All three engines are in-house, bidirectional and transport agnostic (SSH or local ConPTY). ZMODEM takes over **automatically** once its lead-in sequence is spotted in the output stream, and the terminal is restored afterwards. XMODEM and YMODEM have no lead-in on the wire, so they are started **manually** from the command palette (Ctrl+P → "File Transfer") — run `sb`/`rb` on the remote first, then invoke the matching entry. YMODEM supports batches and the YMODEM-G streaming variant. Set `VELASHELL_TRANSFER_TRACE=1` (the old `VELASHELL_ZMODEM_TRACE=1` still works) for frame-level tracing.

- **FTP / FTPS**  
  Built on [FluentFTP](https://github.com/robinrodricks/FluentFTP) (MIT) with a connection pool for concurrent transfers (a single FTP control connection can only run one command at a time), reusing exactly the same dual-pane file browser and transfer stack as SFTP. Rationale in [`velashell-docs en/host/ftp-client-feasibility-research.md`](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/host/ftp-client-feasibility-research.md).

- **Dedicated SFTP tabs and remote file editing**  
  A profile can be SSH or SFTP; SFTP tabs live as their own documents in the dock workspace with local/remote dual-pane browsing, drag-and-drop transfers, resumable transfers and a transfer queue. Remote files open in the built-in editor (AvaloniaEdit, syntax highlighting by extension, plus five hand-written definitions for Shell/YAML/INI/Log/Dockerfile re-skinned for dark themes) and upload on save; you can also hand a file to an external editor and have changes uploaded when it hits disk.

- **Host key trust**  
  First connect records the fingerprint (TOFU) by default, or you can switch to manual confirmation (trust always / trust once / cancel). A changed fingerprint aborts the connection immediately, defeating man-in-the-middle attacks; both SSH and SFTP channels are checked. Trusted hosts can be reviewed and removed in Settings (with address masking so screenshots don't leak them).

- **Port-forwarding tunnels**  
  Local (`-L`), remote (`-R`) and dynamic SOCKS5 (`-D`) forwarding, managed in one place.

### Workspace and operations tooling

- **VelaDock — in-house draggable split view**  
  A dock framework written from scratch with zero third-party dependencies (it replaced Dock.Avalonia): tabs, five-zone edge splitting, merging across groups and tab reordering, so multiple terminals can run side by side.

- **Session management and import**  
  The explorer keeps connection profiles in groups (create/edit/delete/double-click to connect); the sidebar's "recent connections" shows name-group plus relative time, survives restarts, and reconnects on double-click. Existing sessions can be imported from **WinSCP** and **Xshell**.

- **Resource monitor**  
  Live charts for the remote host: CPU (overall, per core, time breakdown, clock, context switches), memory (including cache/buffers/swap), disks (devices, mount points, filesystems, capacity), network connections and the process list.

- **Process manager / traceroute / connection diagnostics**  
  Inspect and kill remote processes; visualise `traceroute` with geographic data (design in [`velashell-docs en/host/route-tracing-design.md`](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/host/route-tracing-design.md)); step-by-step diagnostics when a connection fails.

- **Quick commands and command palette**  
  Send saved command snippets to the current session in one click; `Ctrl+P` / `Ctrl+K` opens the command palette with fuzzy subsequence search over recent sessions, all saved sessions and global commands.

- **Session recording and replay**  
  Optionally record terminal output (stored in SonnetDB's time-series engine, pruned by the log retention setting). The replay centre offers timeline scrubbing, 1x/2x/…/16x speeds and idle-gap skipping, and exports to asciinema-compatible asciicast v2 (`.cast`).

- **Line-number / timestamp gutters**  
  Optional gutters next to terminal output, independently toggled (also via shortcuts), with fold markers and blank-gap handling.

### Plugin system

- **Dual-mode plugin hosting**  
  A plugin can be loaded **in-process** (isolated in a collectible `AssemblyLoadContext`, its UI docked directly into the workspace) or run in a **separate process**, `VelaShell.PluginHost` (custom named-pipe RPC, so a crash never takes down the app, with heartbeats, self-healing restarts and idle recycling). The mode is declared in the plugin manifest; both share the same SDK contract.

- **Capability APIs**  
  Plugins reach host functionality through `IPluginContext`: `Sessions` (enumerate/observe sessions), `Terminal` (read output, write input), `RemoteFs` (remote file read/write and directory listing), `RemoteExec` (run remote commands), `Storage` and `TimeSeries` (per-plugin private document and time-series storage), `Secrets` (host-encrypted secrets), `Commands` (register commands and entry points), `Events` (session/locale/theme events), `Ui` (panels as docked documents or standalone windows), `Clipboard` and `Log`. Dangerous capabilities are granted one by one through a permission dialog.

- **Packaging and management**  
  Plugins ship as `.vpx` packages and can be installed, enabled, disabled and uninstalled from a dedicated plugin manager window; uninstalling also purges the plugin's private data (its SonnetDB namespace and data directory). The SDK ships test doubles (`VelaShell.PluginSdk.Testing`) so plugins can be tested headlessly. Third-party developers get a debugger in one command (`vela-plugin dev init` → F5); see the [dev guide](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/templates/dev-guide.md), [CLI manual](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/cli/cli.md), [SDK reference](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/sdk/sdk-reference.md) and [packaging and publishing](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/templates/publishing.md); marketplace: <http://market.easilynet.top>. Full blueprint in [`velashell-docs en/plugins/`](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/tree/main/en/plugins) (15 design documents + a [status overview](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/plugins/STATUS.md)).

- **AI assistant plugin (first-party)**  
  Multi-provider streaming chat across three wire protocols — OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat Completions-compatible and Anthropic Messages — covering OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM and relay endpoints. Providers are set up from a built-in **catalogue** where **one click connects you**: sign-in providers open your browser, come straight back, store the credential encrypted and configure the model for you — nothing to fill in. The rest ask for an API key and nothing else; name, endpoint, model and protocol ship with factory values tucked behind "Advanced". Both the **authorization-code + PKCE** flow (a loopback port catches the callback) and the **device-code** flow (for when the browser is on another machine) are implemented, and tokens refresh before they expire. If you already pay for **ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro or GitHub Copilot**, you can spend that subscription here — those three borrow the client identity each vendor's own CLI publishes, so they are flagged "experimental" in the UI with an explanation. The model list comes from the endpoint's own `/models` (only it knows what that address actually serves), with context windows and pricing filled in by id from the open **models.dev** dataset. **Agent mode** runs a Microsoft.Extensions.AI `FunctionInvokingChatClient` tool loop bridged to sessions / terminal / remoteExec / remoteFs, with per-command approval for dangerous operations, and can attach custom **MCP servers** (stdio / HTTP) for extra tools. It also ships **web search and fetch** tools (a public SearXNG instance by default, swap in your own), so the model can look things up before answering. You can **interject** while the agent is running: a new message joins the queue and is picked up without waiting for the current turn to finish. Conversations are persisted to the plugin's private time-series store: browse history, resume a conversation, delete one or clear all; `↑`/`↓` recalls previous prompts and `@` opens a remote file picker for the selected session, attaching file contents to the message. The composer itself is an editor with **Markdown highlighting**, where `@` references render as themed short-name chips (full path on hover), and message bubbles are rendered as Markdown.

### Data, appearance and updates

- **Embedded SonnetDB storage**  
  Everything persistent (profiles, groups, settings, known_hosts, snippets, connection history, audit log, recordings, plugin data) lives in a local embedded [SonnetDB](https://github.com/IoTSharp/SonnetDB) multi-model database: document collections for business data, the time-series engine for recent connections, audit entries and recording chunks. Connection passwords and key passphrases are written with **AES-256-GCM** encryption.

- **GitHub Gist cloud sync**  
  Settings, connection profiles (including groups and tunnels) and snippets sync to a private Gist under your own account for seamless multi-device roaming. Every sync is a revisitable revision and any revision can be restored. Optional passphrase-based end-to-end encryption (PBKDF2 + AES-256-GCM); with encryption off, credentials are never uploaded.

- **Settings centre**  
  Twelve pages: General, Appearance, Terminal, Proxy, Key management, Shortcuts, File transfer, Security audit, Snippets, Cloud sync, About, and Support & donate. Key management enumerates `~/.ssh` keys (type + SHA256 fingerprint), generates RSA key pairs, and imports/copies public keys. The Shortcuts page is generated from `ShortcutCatalog` as the single source of truth, same as [`velashell-docs en/host/keyboard-shortcuts.md`](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/host/keyboard-shortcuts.md).

- **Dark / light / system themes**  
  Fully tokenised design with no hard-coded colours and runtime switching; unless customised, the terminal palette follows the theme (dark = Dracula, light = Solarized Light). Scrollbars follow the Windows 11 two-state model — a thin resting line that expands into a track with arrows on hover.

- **Bundled terminal font**  
  Cascadia Mono ships with the app in four styles (regular / bold / italic / bold-italic) as the default terminal font for identical glyphs on all three platforms; CJK falls back to system fonts.

- **Live status bar**  
  Connection state, latency, uptime, terminal size, encoding and CPU / memory / network throughput at a glance.

- **Desktop integration**  
  Single instance (launching again raises the existing window), minimise to tray, launch at login, and a hardware-acceleration switch (turning it off saves roughly 170 MB of resident memory).

## 🖥️ Platform support

| Platform | Architecture | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Windows 10 / 11 | x64 / arm64 | ✅ Fully supported (portable zip, in-app updates; also on Microsoft Store as MSIX) |
| Linux | x64 / arm64 | ✅ Fully supported (portable tar.gz, single-file `.AppImage`, native `.deb` / `.rpm`) |
| macOS | x64 / arm64 | ✅ Fully supported (tar.gz + drag-install `.dmg`, unsigned/not notarised) |

Releases are **self-contained**, so no .NET runtime is required on the target machine. [`scripts/publish-all.ps1`](scripts/publish-all.ps1) produces every platform package in one go — see [Build & release](#-build--release).

---

## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) **11.0.0 or newer** (pinned by `global.json` with `rollForward: latestFeature`; currently built with `11.0.100-preview.x`)
- (Optional) Docker, to run the local SSH test server

> ⚠️ The repo targets **net11.0** with `EnablePreviewFeatures` and `runtime-async=on` (see `Directory.Build.props`), so building requires a .NET 11 preview SDK. If you need an LTS baseline, roll `<TargetFramework>` in `Directory.Build.props` and `global.json` back to net10 together.

### Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell
cd VelaShell

# Build the whole solution (including the plugin host)
dotnet build

# Or just the desktop entry project
dotnet build src/VelaShell/VelaShell.csproj
```

> A clean clone builds with only the **AI plugin** this repo produces itself. To run Redis / S3 / Telnet alongside it locally, drop their plugin directories into `artifacts/plugins/` (or point elsewhere with `-p:VelaPluginsStageDir=<dir>`) — they are mirrored into `plugins/<plugin-dir>/` under the app's output directory on every build, so F5 picks them up. `dotnet publish` fails only when both the in-repo plugins and the staging directory are empty — a release package must not ship "a plugin system that looks present but has no plugins".
>
> Since 2026-08-22 the **release pipeline no longer preinstalls** Redis / S3 / Telnet (not everyone needs Redis, S3 or Telnet); users install them on demand from the [plugin marketplace](https://market.easilynet.top). Staging is purely a local affair: once staged, your own `dotnet publish` output will include those plugins, which only affects your own build.
>
> **Building while the app is running fails on locked files** — close the app first.

### Run

```bash
# Development (hot reload)
dotnet watch run --project src/VelaShell/VelaShell.csproj

# Publish a standalone Windows executable
dotnet publish src/VelaShell/VelaShell.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

### Start the test SSH server

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
# username: testuser, password: testpass
# port: 2222
```

### Where data lives

| Content | Location |
|---------|----------|
| SonnetDB data directory (profiles/groups/settings/known_hosts/history/audit/recordings/plugin data) | `~/.velashell/sonnetdb` |
| Credential encryption key (AES-256) | `~/.velashell/secret.key` |
| Manually installed plugins (`.vpx`) | `~/.velashell/plugins` (first-party plugins remain in the application's `plugins/` directory) |
| Host self-registration (lets `vela-plugin` locate the install and check versions) | `~/.velashell/host.json` |
| Plugin development mounts and shadow copies | `~/.velashell/plugins.dev.txt`, `~/.velashell/dev-shadow/` |
| SSH key pairs (Key management page) | `~/.ssh` |

> Legacy JSON configuration (`sessions.json` / `settings.json` …) is imported into SonnetDB on first run and renamed to `*.migrated.bak`.
> When upgrading from the former data root, VelaShell verifies and migrates everything under `%LocalAppData%/VelaShell` into `~/.velashell`, then removes the former directory. Conflicting files already present in `~/.velashell` are preserved under `.migration-backup/localappdata/`.

---

## 📦 Build & release

```bash
# Produce every platform package in one run (output in publish/)
pwsh scripts/publish-all.ps1
```

Artifacts cover Windows x64/arm64 (portable zip) plus macOS and Linux x64/arm64 (tar.gz), all self-contained — unpack anywhere and run, no .NET required. Each package carries the isolated-plugin host process `VelaShell.PluginHost` plus a `plugins/` directory holding only the in-house AI plugin (Redis / S3 / Telnet have not been preinstalled since 2026-08-22 — users install them from the marketplace on demand). The macOS `.dmg` drag-install image is produced only on CI's macOS runner (`hdiutil`/`iconutil`/`codesign` are macOS-only tools); Beyond the tar.gz, Linux ships three more: a single-file `.AppImage` (`chmod +x` and double-click — see `build/appimage/README.md`) plus native `.deb` / `.rpm` packages (installed into `/opt/velashell`, registering a menu entry and `/usr/bin/velashell` — see `build/linux-packages/README.md`), one of each per architecture, all cross-built on the same x64 runner. **The updater always consumes the tar.gz**; the dmg, AppImage, deb and rpm exist purely for manual download and installation — once installed their application directory is not writable, so the About page degrades to "download it manually".

> Microsoft Store (MSIX) installs are updated by the Store, so in-app update actions are hidden there. The Store build lives under the read-only `WindowsApps` directory and its data folder is redirected to a package-private location, so **its settings, sessions and keys are separate from the portable build's**.

**In-app updates**: Settings → About → Check for updates. The app reads the `latest.json` manifest from GitHub Releases, downloads the matching archive into a staging directory inside the app folder, verifies SHA-256, unpacks it, and then lets an external swap process — which only starts after the app exits — replace the files and relaunch. By then nothing in the app directory is locked, so no undeletable leftovers remain. That "external process" *is* the freshly unpacked new version (releases are self-contained and **not** single-file, so they run straight from disk), which is why no separate updater has to be shipped. Updates happen wherever the app is installed, with no location requirement; the `~/.velashell` data directory is completely isolated from the update flow, so upgrades and rollbacks never touch user data. A failed swap rolls back to the previous version automatically, and if the flow is interrupted, "Repair update state" on the About page resets it. The update channel (stable / preview) is switchable in Settings.

**CI/CD**: [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) triggers when a GitHub Release is published and builds on all three native runners in parallel (the version comes from the Release tag via `-p:Version`, so releasing needs no code changes), then attaches `SHA256SUMS.txt` and the `latest.json` update manifest to the Release. The same pipeline also produces an **MSIX** for Microsoft Store submission (deliberately unsigned — the Store signs it with its own certificate after certification).

> The earlier WiX MSI and Velopack installers were removed in `241c2a2`: installing into Program Files makes the app directory read-only, degrading in-app updates to "please download manually", which conflicts with the portable self-update model.

### 🧩 Three repositories, one job each

Everything plugin-related now lives outside this repository. Five repositories plus a docs
repository, one job each:

| Repository | Owns | How it reaches this repo |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **joesdu/VelaShell** (this one) | The app + the host-side plugin runtime + the in-house AI plugin | — |
| **[VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugin-sdk](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugin-sdk)** | The plugin contract SDK | `VelaShell.PluginSdk` / `.Testing` **NuGet packages** |
| **[VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugin-cli](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugin-cli)** | The `vela-plugin` CLI and `VelaShell.PluginSdk.Build` | **NuGet packages** (for plugin authors; not referenced here) |
| **[VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugin-templates](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugin-templates)** | The `dotnet new velaplugin` templates | **NuGet package** (for plugin authors; not referenced here) |
| **[VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugins](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugins)** | The Redis / S3 / Telnet / Serial plugins | One **`.vpx` package** per plugin (release assets / marketplace) |
| **[VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs)** | **All documentation** for every repository above | — |

> The split happened in steps: on 2026-08-21 the SDK, toolchain and plugins moved into
> `velashell-plugin-toolchain`; on 2026-08-22 the plugins moved out again; on 2026-08-27 the
> toolchain repo was split into sdk / cli / templates so each could release on its own cadence;
> on 2026-08-30 all documentation was consolidated into `velashell-docs`. Older docs claiming
> "the plugins live in the toolchain repo" or "the docs live under each repo's `docs/`" are obsolete.

**The AI plugin is the exception**: it lives here in
[`plugins/VelaShell.Plugin.Ai/`](plugins/VelaShell.Plugin.Ai) and is a first-party plugin built
and released together with the app — it is the one most tightly coupled to the host (it borrows
the host's AvaloniaEdit for its input box, must load in-process, and must compile against the
exact Avalonia version the host loads). The reasoning is in
[`plugins/README.md`](plugins/README.md).

The SDK contract is pinned in `src/Directory.Packages.props` and `tests/Directory.Packages.props`
(literal versions). Plugin binaries are not pinned here — they never enter a release package, so
there is no version to lock.

To run Redis / S3 / Telnet alongside the app on your own machine, drop their plugin directories
into the **staging directory** `artifacts/plugins/`: unpack the per-plugin **`.vpx` packages**
released by [VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugins](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugins)
(`.vpx` is VelaShell's own plugin package format; the container's layout is exactly the installed
`plugins/<plugin>/` level), or point straight at that repo's build output. Pass `-p:VelaPluginsStageDir=<dir>` to stage elsewhere.

> ⚠️ Do not stage `velashell-ai` — this repo already produces it, and two plugins with the same id
> make `PluginManager` mark the later one Invalid, which shows up as "the plugin mysteriously
> doesn't work".

To change the SDK contract, publish a (pre-release) package from the toolchain repository first,
then bump the `VelaShell.PluginSdk` version in `src/Directory.Packages.props`,
`tests/Directory.Packages.props` and
`plugins/VelaShell.Plugin.Ai/VelaShell.Plugin.Ai.csproj` together — this repository always
consumes the SDK as a NuGet package, never as a project reference.

**To write a plugin, read the [dev guide](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/templates/dev-guide.md)**;
the plugin architecture blueprint lives in
[velashell-docs `en/plugins/`](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/tree/main/en/plugins) — that is host-side design.

## 🧩 Architecture highlights

- **Strict layering**: dependencies flow `App(VelaShell) → Presentation / Controls / Infrastructure → Core`. Core depends on no UI framework, so it is independently testable and reusable.
- **Interfaces first**: services are injected through interfaces, which keeps mocking and unit testing straightforward.
- **Single composition root**: all DI registration is centralised in [`src/VelaShell/App.axaml.cs`](src/VelaShell/App.axaml.cs), with each layer contributing via `*ServiceCollectionExtensions`.
- **Custom rendering**: the terminal draws glyphs, selection and scrolling directly in a custom Avalonia control instead of depending on abandoned third-party terminal controls.
- **In-house docking**: VelaDock separates its model layer (plain INPC, unit-testable) from its controls; dragging, splitting and tab reordering are all ours, with zero third-party dock dependencies.
- **Plugin isolation**: each in-process plugin gets a collectible `AssemblyLoadContext` and resolves its dependencies from its own `deps.json`; only the SDK contract and `Avalonia*` framework assemblies fall back to the host, which keeps types identical across the boundary. Plugins that need stronger isolation run in a separate process over custom named-pipe RPC.
- **Tokenised design**: colours, fonts and spacing all live in resource dictionaries, enabling theming and rebranding.
- **One persistence engine**: a single embedded SonnetDB instance serves both document (configuration/business data) and time-series (history/audit/recordings/plugin data) models — interfaces in Core, implementation in Infrastructure, flushed on exit; legacy JSON configuration migrates automatically on first run.
- **Secure defaults**: credentials encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM plus a local key file), TOFU host fingerprint verification, "remember password" disableable per connection, and per-capability consent for plugins.

## 🧪 Tests

The repo carries an MSTest suite covering domain models, the VT engine, view models, the plugin system and integration scenarios (7 test projects, including real two-process plugin e2e tests and headless UI tests).

```bash
# Run everything
dotnet test

# Only the terminal engine
dotnet test tests/VelaShell.Terminal.Tests/

# Verbose output
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

| Test project | Scope |
|--------------|-------|
| `VelaShell.Core.Tests` | Domain models, SFTP and the transfer queue, tunnels, sync encryption, ZMODEM / XMODEM / YMODEM (interop regressions against hand-built lrzsz and ymodem.txt wire bytes) |
| `VelaShell.Terminal.Tests` | VT parsing, emulation, encodings, character widths, gutter folding, plus ZMODEM auto-takeover and XMODEM / YMODEM manual-takeover routing |
| `VelaShell.Presentation.Tests` | View-model workflows and commands |
| `VelaShell.Infrastructure.Tests` | SonnetDB persistence, credential encryption, ConPTY, SSH key management, plugin management and cross-process RPC |
| `VelaShell.Controls.Tests` | Custom control behaviour |
| `VelaShell.Plugin.Ai.Tests` | AI plugin: toolbox approval gate, capability bridging, settings/secret storage, chat history, `@` reference syntax and headless panel interaction |
| `VelaShell.Tests` | Window-level view models, authentication flow, plugin panels and theme tokens, integration and smoke tests |

> Integration tests **bail out early** when their environment is missing: `SshIntegrationTests` and `TransferRealChannelIntegrationTests` (category `DockerIntegration`) need Docker plus the SSH server from `docker-compose.test.yml`, and the ZMODEM ones additionally need `lrzsz` to be installable inside the container; `CrossPlatformPublishTests` needs `VELASHELL_PUBLISH_TESTS=1`.
>
> ⚠️ **An early bail-out counts as "passed" in MSTest.** When the prerequisites are absent these tests go quietly green without executing a single line — the test result alone cannot tell you the difference. The gate itself has to be honest too: probing the TCP port is not enough, because Docker's port proxy **always** accepts the connection even when the sshd behind it cannot complete a handshake, so the fixture now caches one real SSH handshake and decides from that. To confirm they actually ran, look for `[SKIP]` lines in `TestContext`.
>
> ⚠️ In headless UI tests, always use the **value-returning** overload — `Dispatch(async () => { …; return true; })`. `HeadlessUnitTestSession` has no `Func<Task>` overload, so a void-returning lambda yields a `Task<Task>` that is never awaited: the body stops at the first `await`, the test "passes", and every assertion failure is lost.

## 📚 Documentation

All documentation moved to **[VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs)**
on 2026-08-30 — the `docs/` and `docs-en/` trees of this repository, the SDK, the CLI and the
templates now live there together, linking to each other by relative path instead of cross-repo URLs.
English in [`en/`](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/tree/main/en), 中文在 [`zh/`](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/tree/main/zh).

Three documents stay here, because what they serve is writing code *in this repository*:

- [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) — design system: colour/type/spacing tokens and component rules (XAML comments and unit tests cite its section numbers directly)
- [`plan.md`](plan.md) — **what already happened**: the progress log, the current architecture, and the reasoning behind every change
- [`feature-plan.md`](feature-plan.md) — **what has not happened yet**: the backlog, candidate features, and the won't-do list with its reasons

> The split is strict: once something ships it comes off `feature-plan.md` and gets a section in `plan.md`; anything unshipped stays out of `plan.md` — no TODOs there.

## 🚧 Project status

The project is under active development.

**Working today**: terminal engine, SSH/SFTP, FTP/FTPS, ZMODEM / XMODEM / YMODEM, local shells, jump hosts, session management and import, authentication, tunnels, persistence, settings centre, cloud sync, session recording, resource monitor / process manager / traceroute, plus the **plugin system framework** (dual hosting modes, the full capability surface, UI extensions, heartbeat self-healing and idle recycling, per-plugin storage with uninstall cleanup, `.vpx` install/uninstall, SDK test doubles and developer docs) and the first-party **AI assistant plugin**.

**Provided by plugins** — none preinstalled; install on demand from the [plugin marketplace](https://market.easilynet.top):

- **Telnet, serial (COM / USB-to-serial), Redis and S3** — sources in [VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugins](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-plugins).
- **Docker panel** — [VelaShell.Plugin.DockerPanel](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/VelaShell.Plugin.DockerPanel) (its own repository). A full Docker management surface on top of an **already-connected SSH session**: seven pages (overview / containers / images / volumes / networks / Compose / system) plus live stats, a merged multi-container log stream, in-container file editing and a built-in TTY console. **Nothing changes on the server** — it opens a direct channel to the remote `/var/run/docker.sock` over the SSH session (`direct-streamlocal@openssh.com`) and speaks the Docker Engine HTTP API, so the daemon need not be exposed on 2375/2376 and no second set of credentials is required. Nor is it a local port forward, so no other process on your machine can reach it.

**Not yet available**: SSH certificate authentication; system keychain and sudo credential autofill are still under investigation. A handful of settings are persisted but not yet wired to runtime behaviour (itemised in the P0 table of `feature-plan.md`).

The completion record lives in [`plan.md`](plan.md), the backlog and plans in [`feature-plan.md`](feature-plan.md), and the plugin-side progress in [`velashell-docs en/plugins/STATUS.md`](https://github.com/VelaShellLabs/velashell-docs/blob/main/en/plugins/STATUS.md).
